## [What is ZTK?]

ZTK is a file format to describe data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
## [Concept]

Syntax is not for computers but for humans. Too strong rules of
syntax should be ruled out. Parenthesization, indentation,
delimination and line-feed rovides better readability for humans,
but should not constrain the way of description. This is the
design concept of ZTK.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
## [Syntax]

The following is a simple example along with on ZTK format.

```
[tag1]
key1: val1 val2 val3
key2: val4
key3: val5 val6

[tag2]
key1: val7 val8 val9
key1: val10 val11 val12
key2: val13

[tag1]
key1: val14 val15 val6
```

But, all the following lines are parsed also in the same way.

```
key1: val1 val2 val3
key1: val1, val2, val3
key1:val1,val2,val3
key1: (val1, val2, val3)
key1: { val1, val2, val3 }
key1: val1;val2;val3
```

Obviously, the whitespaces, semicolons, commas, parentheses
and braces are all identified as delimiters. Even the following
lines are accepted.

```
key1: (val1 val2 val3}
key1: (val1 val2 val3
```

The following also works.

```
key1:
 val1
 val2
 val3
```

Except, the following has a different semantic.

```
key1 "val1 val2 val3"
```

Single/double quotations concatenate several splitted words into
one string. Actually, the parse unit of ZTK format is not a word
but a string.

Brackets [] and colons : have special roles to make tags and keys.
